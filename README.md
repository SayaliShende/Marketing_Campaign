In the face of a significant decline in subscriptions over the past year, the magazine company is confronted with a pressing challenge—to uncover the underlying factors contributing to this unexpected downturn. Despite the initial assumption that increased time spent at home would lead to higher readership, the company grapples with the reality of declining engagement. To systematically dissect and comprehend the complexities of this decline, the company has embarked on a journey into predictive modeling, utilizing two powerful techniques—logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM). The choice of these models is strategic, with logistic regression's proficiency in analyzing binary outcomes and SVM's strength in classifying intricate datasets. By deploying both models, the company seeks to discern the unique insights each can provide, aiming to not only unravel the factors influencing subscription rates but also to evaluate which modeling approach proves more effective in solving the intricate puzzle at hand. Through this dual-model approach, the company endeavors to extract comprehensive insights, enabling informed strategic decisions to rejuvenate subscription rates and reestablish itself in the ever-evolving landscape of customer engagement.
